            This example shows what happens after a first prompt is sent. MemoSync holds that exact
            message and opens <strong>Long-term Memory Management</strong> over the still-visible
            chat. Creating the chat itself does not open this review.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the same <strong>Memory Board</strong> used later in the session. It has one fixed
            order: <strong>Step 1 Candidate review</strong>, the three-column Memory Board,{" "}
            <strong>Step 2 Transfer</strong>, then <strong>Step 3 Suggested Changes</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This opening Board has no Close button while review remains. There is no separate current
            review or library mode: the review stations and the Personal, Project, and Session
            columns live on this one page. The count at the top is server-authoritative, so search or
            filtering cannot hide unfinished work.

          <p>
            During a session you can reopen the same board any time with the{" "}
