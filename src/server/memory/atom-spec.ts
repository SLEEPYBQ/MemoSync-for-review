- Each memory unit expresses exactly one independently judgeable proposition: one fact, preference, constraint, or lesson.
- Split independent propositions into separate units. Keep a condition, exception, reason, or consequence with its governing proposition when separating it would change the meaning.
- Make content standalone and semantically complete. Resolve pronouns only from supplied evidence; never invent missing context.
- Preserve the actor, object, action, negation, modality, values, units, temporal qualifiers, and applicability conditions needed to judge correctness.
- Keep Scope separate from Content. Do not encode storage lifetime or reach merely as prose in content.
- Detail may add evidence, examples, or explanation, but it must not contain a qualifier required for the content to be correct.`;
